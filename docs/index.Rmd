__Team Airtraffic has created insightful visualizations of air traffic from / to Zurich Airport and built farly acurate delay prediction models__

At the TWIST-Hackdays, the *terrific* __Team Airtraffic__ has: 

- conducted __exploratory data analysis__ and produced many descriptive visualizations to get to know the data and get a first understanding of which aspects of it might be relevant and interesting
- experimented with a broad variety of modelling approaches (linear approaches, binary logistic regressions, ridge regression, baynesian approaches) __to predict delays__
-the fitted models predicted delays on the test data with a high accuracy


# What We've achieved!

[1. Explorative Data Analysis]()

[2. Flight Delay Predictions]()

[3. Geogiffery!]()

# What we could have done (with a bit more time)

A (shiny) prototype of a __flight prediction app__ based on the best prediction models!

__Team Airtraffic has created insightful visualizations of air traffic from / to Zurich Airport and built farly acurate delay prediction models__

At the TWIST-Hackdays, Team Airtraffic has: 

- conducted __exploratory data analysis__ and produced many descriptive visualizations to get to know the data and get a first understanding of which aspects of it might be relevant and interesting
- experimented with a broad variety of modelling approaches (linear approaches, binary logistic regressions, ridge regression, baynesian approaches) __to predict delays__
-the fitted models predicted delays on the test data with a high accuracy

__Next steps :__

1. Try further prediction-approaches (baynesian, random forest e.g.) 
2. Create some further insightful visualizations
2. Discuss what the model could be used for (flight delay prediction app? )
